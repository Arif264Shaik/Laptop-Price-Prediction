# Laptop Price Prediction

## Overview
The Laptop Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using machine learning algorithms. 
This application leverages data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to provide insights into laptop pricing.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from various online sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features impacting laptop prices.
- **Model Training**: Implemented machine learning algorithms for price prediction.
- **User Interface**: (Optional) Built a simple GUI for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - seaborn (for data visualization)
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  - sklearn (for spliting train, test and model building)
  - (Optional) Tkinter (for GUI)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arif264Shaik/laptop-price-prediction.git
   cd laptop-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the machine learning model using the training dataset.
3. Use the trained model to predict laptop prices based on user input.

## Results
- Include visualizations or metrics that demonstrate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, RMSE).
- You can use Matplotlib to plot graphs showing the relationship between features and prices.

## Important Notes
- Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before running the model.
- Modify any parameters in the model training section to optimize performance.
